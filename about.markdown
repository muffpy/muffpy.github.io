This is a personal web blog where I write down some thoughts that relate to my work, interests and favourite books among other things. The blog itself is very sparse right now so I haven't added any taxonomy pages. As I write down more pieces, the blog will be geared for a better user experience.

You can find out more about me at [https://muffpy.github.io/](/).

This website was created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll).
